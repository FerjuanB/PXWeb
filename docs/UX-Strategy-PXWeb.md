# Project X Innovation — UX/UI Strategy (2025)

This document analyzes current project direction (per the provided mind map) and outlines a modern, research-backed UX/UI plan for a B2B tech consulting site with strong AI, ERP/NetSuite, EDI, and B2B catalog capabilities. It focuses on conversion, credibility, accessibility, and implementation feasibility in Next.js.

---

## 1) What we have (from the mind map)
- **Services (B2B Tech Department)**
  - B2B Website (Ecommerce, SEO, Integrations, Upselling/Cross-selling, “Addictiveness”/engagement)
  - Sales tools
  - ERP Management (NetSuite)
  - AI (very strong focus)
  - EDI (fast/easy)
  - Custom reporting
  - PIMS/Product Catalogue
- **Vibe / Messaging**
  - Bring your business into the modern era; future-ready
  - “I know I should be using AI but how does it AI?”
  - You don’t need to do anything → biweekly tech powwow
  - Not hourly devs; pay for results and only results
  - Consistent realization of year plan sprint by sprint

---

## 2) What’s missing (gaps to fill)
- Clear information architecture and navigation labels geared to buyers
- Social proof system (logos, testimonials, quantified results)
- Case studies with challenge → solution → results storytelling
- Service detail pages with outcomes, process, FAQs, and CTAs
- Pricing/engagement models (workshop, retainer, fixed-scope) with comparison
- Contact/qualification: multi-step form + calendar booking + rapid triage
- AI offering showcase with demos and ROI visualization
- B2B catalog patterns: search, filters, RFQ, role-based pricing, dashboards
- Accessibility, performance, and SEO guardrails (tokens, semantics, CWV)
- Consistent design tokens for color/spacing/typography and motion system

---

## 3) Site map (recommended)
- Home
- Services
  - AI Solutions (RAG search, Automations, Copilots)
  - ERP/NetSuite Integration
  - EDI Connectivity
  - B2B Ecommerce & Website
  - Custom Reporting & Analytics
  - PIM/Product Catalog
- Case Studies
- Resources (Blog, Playbooks, Whitepapers)
- About (Team, Approach, Certifications/Partners)
- Pricing & Engagement
- Contact / Book a Call
- Account (for B2B catalog feature set, if enabled later)

---

## 4) Page blueprints (UX/UI patterns)

### 4.1 Home (hero-first, fast credibility)
- Clear headline: value and ideal customer (B2B, ops/IT/commerce leaders)
- Subhead with 2–3 measurable outcomes
- Primary CTA: “Talk to an Expert” + Secondary: “See AI in Action”
- Client logo strip (top-third of page)
- Services overview grid (linking to detail pages)
- Case study highlights with KPIs
- AI demo teaser and ROI calculator teaser
- Proof and badges (partners, compliance, certifications)
- Final CTA with contact + calendar embed

### 4.2 Service page module
- Above-the-fold summary: problem → what we deliver → outcomes
- Process timeline (Discovery → Pilot → Rollout → Success)
- Feature cards with short loops/gifs or diagrams
- Related case studies and FAQs
- Sticky sidebar: key stats, timeline, CTA

### 4.3 AI services landing
- Sections: RAG Search, Automations, Copilots
- For each: problem, how it works, security/compliance, outcomes, short demo/gif
- Interactive demo (sandbox) or guided walkthrough (if mock): input sample data
- ROI calculator (time saved x frequency x cost per hour → annual ROI)
- Trust (logos, video quotes), CTA to pilot/workshop

### 4.4 Case study layout
- Narrative: Challenge → Solution → Results (metrics, before/after)
- Visuals: diagrams, short explainers, product shots
- Sticky facts: industry, scope, timeline, stack
- Related services and CTA

### 4.5 Pricing & Engagement
- Cards: Workshop, Fixed Scope, Retainer
- Comparison table: deliverables, SLAs, best-for
- CTA: Book a consultation; FAQ on procurement/security

### 4.6 Contact / Qualification
- Multi-step form: basics → problem area → urgency/budget → book time
- Calendar integration and instant confirmation email
- Optional live chat / call-back component

---

## 5) B2B catalog (PIM/ERP/EDI) patterns to include
- Global predictive search; typo tolerance
- Faceted filters; bulk select; compare; CSV import/export
- PDP with tabs: attributes/specs, downloads (CAD/MSDS), pricing tiers, stock
- RFQ flow (add-to-quote from list/PDP; attachments; thread)
- Role-based pricing and availability from ERP (timestamp + source note)
- Account dashboards: quotes, orders, approvals, reorders, EDI status
- Permissions: buyer/approver/finance roles; credit limit visibility
- Notifications: price/inventory changes, quote progress, order status

---

## 6) Visual system (2025 patterns)
- Tokens: color, spacing, radius, shadows, typography (light/dark)
- Grid: fluid editorial sections; 8pt spacing; 12-column responsive
- Motion: subtle microinteractions; 200–300ms; reduce motion setting respected
- Imagery: high-contrast product/diagram visuals; subtle noise/gradients only
- Components: cards, iconography, pill badges, segmented controls

---

## 7) Accessibility & performance
- WCAG 2.2 AA: color contrast, focus states, keyboard flows
- Semantics: landmarks, headings, aria labels; skip to content
- Forms: labels, error messaging, autocomplete
- Performance: Next.js SSG/ISR; image optimization; prefetch; Core Web Vitals
- SEO: metadata, OG, structured data for services/case studies, sitemap

---

## 8) Content strategy cues (voice & vibe)
- Outcomes-first language; quantify impact when possible
- Avoid jargon; explain acronyms (RAG, EDI) on first mention
- Reusable proof snippets (quotes, metrics) across pages
- “Pay for results” positioning clarified with engagement models

---

## 9) Prioritized implementation plan (phased)

### Phase 1 — Foundations (week 1–2)

- Global navigation and footer; responsive header with mega-menu if needed
- Home MVP: hero, services grid, logos, 1–2 case highlights, CTA strip
- Contact page with multi-step form + calendar embed
- Analytics and event tracking (CTA clicks, form steps)

### Phase 2 — Services & Proof (week 3–4)
- Service page template; populate AI, ERP, EDI, B2B Ecommerce, Reporting, PIM
- Case study template; publish 2–3 with measurable outcomes
- Pricing/Engagement page with comparison table

### Phase 3 — AI Demos & ROI (week 5–6)
- Interactive demo modules (mocked if necessary)
- ROI calculator component
- Security/compliance page or section

### Phase 4 — B2B Catalog (PIM/ERP/EDI) (week 7–10)
- Catalog list with search/filters/compare
- PDP with tabs/downloads/pricing tiers
- RFQ flow and account dashboard scaffolding
- ERP/NetSuite data stubs; later replace with live APIs

---

## 11) Measurement & experimentation

- A/B tests on hero headline/CTA and service value props

---

## 12) References (research used)

## 13) Next steps
- Approve the site map and page blueprints
- Choose 2–3 initial case studies to write
- Decide which AI demo(s) we can prototype first
- Confirm engagement models for the Pricing page
- If catalog features are in-scope now, pick initial category and sample data
